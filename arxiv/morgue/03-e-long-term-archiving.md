It is worth distinguishing between sharing data and publishing data. One can share data in numerous ways without going through the trouble of publishing it, which often requires metadata that a human must verify. Data can be shared in numerous ways including by placing it in a repository, packaging it with methods, or by using various free tiers of commercial services. However, one must publish data when appropriate.


There are a three common options for publishing data in research:

1. **Least Moving Parts**
2. **Domain Specific Venue**
3. **Long Term Archive**

We discuss each of these options and provide recommendations on how to publish data in these areas.

In **Least Moving Parts**, the data might be published with an R package, or as part of a GitHub release using piggyback @piggyback, or a in serverless databaseses. This approach **gets the data somewhere rather than nowhere**. It's minimal features means it is simple to maintain. A downsides is that it does not scale to larger data. Self hosting the data is an option, but we discourage this, as it may succumb to bit rot.

In **Domain Specific Venue**, data can be published in journal data papers, or venues specific to the type of data. For example, in astronomy the data is hosted at the SDSS (SDSS), Genetic data can be hosted at GenBank (@GenBank), and so on.  Some other places to put data include the open science framework: https://osf.io/, dataverse, https://dataverse.org/, and data.world, https://data.world/. Other datasets might be produced

The purpose, use, and origin of the data is an important component to consider. Data for research has a different domain compared to data collected by governments, or by journalists. Many governments or civil organisations are now making their own data available through a government website interface. Media and journalism groups are also making their data available either through places like GitHub (https://github.com/the-pudding/data), or organisations such as data.world, or may self host their data (https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/).

This is a good option when the data is appropriate for the domain. This is often decided by community standards. We recommend adhering to community standards for a location to publish your data, as this will likely improve data reuse. The guidelines suggested in this paper for sharing the data should be included.

A **Long Term Archive** is the best option to share the data. Long term archives provide information such as DOI (Digital Object Identifier) that make it easier to cite. Data can be placed in a long term archive and a DOI can be minted. This DOI can then be used in other venues, such as domain specific or even self hosted, and will ensure that the projects refer back appropriately.

If the dataset you are shipping has a research application, the most relevant home for it would be Zenodo, a research data repository. Launched in 2013 in a joint collaboration between openAIRE and CERN, Zenodo provides a free, archival location for any researcher to depositor their datasets. The only limits to file sizes are 50gb for individual files, which is generous enough to accommodate a large number of use cases. Zenodo is able to accommodate larger file sizes upon request.

**Principles for all three**

The data should contain information on metadata, data dictionaries, the README, and data used in analysis (ref section 2). No matter where data is submitted, there should ideally be a canonical data repo in one long term archive that links to others with a DOI

## Publishing data in a data repository



## Publishing data through a data journal

Data used in publications are often shared in the supplementary materials of articles, or served on repositories such as the Dryad Digital Repository (@dryad). Dryad makes data from scientific publications discoverable, reusable, and citable. It is well funded through grants from the NSF, European Commission.

To provide better context around the data used in research and better expose data for reuse, journals are now adding "data papers". These are specifically designed for publishing articles about the data, and sharing it. This benefits both researchers and readers. Researchers receive credit for data they have collected or produced. Readers get more context about the data.

Data papers are similar to research articles, they have titles, authors, affiliations, abstract, and references.  They generally require an explanation of why the data is useful to others, a direct link to the data, description of the design, materials, and methods. Other information on the subject area, data type, format, and related articles are usually required.

Whilst useful, these requirements do not tell the author how to actually structure the data and folders. Instead providing ideas on what they should include. This is a useful step towards improving data reuse, but it _lacks some minimal structure that allows a researcher to have a predictable way to access and interpret the data_.

Other journals operating in this space include journals like "data in brief", "Data", and "Nature Scientific Data". Guidelines for what is required in the content of the paper, and the required information along with the data (meta data, data format, etc.) vary by journal.
