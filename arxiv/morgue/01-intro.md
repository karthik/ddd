# Introduction

Data are a fundamental currency upon which scientific discoveries are made. Without access to good data, it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to advance science. Yet, a large majority of data on which published research papers are based rarely see the light of day and are only visible to the original authors (citation).  Sharing datasets upon publication of a research paper has benefits to individual researchers, often through increased visibility of the work. But there is also a component of benefit to the broader scientific community. This primarily comes in the form of potential for reuse in other contexts along use for training and teaching (@McKiernan2016). Assuming that the data have no privacy concerns (e.g., human subjects, locations of critically endangered species), or that the act of sharing doesn't put the authors at a competitive disadvantage, sharing data will always have a net positive benefit. First and foremost, sharing data along with other artifacts can make it easier for a reader to independently reproduce the results, thereby increasing transparency and trust in the work. The act of easy data sharing can also improves model training, as many different models can be tried and tested on latest data sources, closing the loop on research and application of statistical techniques. Existing datasets can be combined or linked with new or existing data, fostering the development and synthesis of new ideas and research areas. The biggest of these benefits is the overall increase in reproducibility.

For nearly two decades, researchers who work in areas related to computational science have pushed for better standards to verify scientific claims, especially in areas where a full replication of the study would be prohibitively expensive. To meet these minimal standards, there must be easy access to the data, models, and code. Among the different areas with a computational bent, the bioinformatics community in particular has a strong culture around open source [@Gentleman2004], and has made releasing code and associated software a recognized mainstream activity. Many journals in these fields have also pushed authors to submit code (model implementations) alongside their papers, with a few journals going as far as providing a "reproducibility review" [@Peng2011].

**In this paper we focus on the practical side of sharing data for the purpose of reproducibility.** Our goal is to describe various methods in which an analyst can share their data with minimal friction. We steer clear of theoretical ideas such as the FAIR data principles [@Wilkinson2016] since they still do not help a researcher share their data. We also skip the discussion around citation and credit because data citations are still poorly tracked and there is no standardized metric or a h-index equivalent for data as of this writing. 

For a piece of computational research to be minimally reproducible, it requires three distinct elements:

1. Code  
2. Computing environment  
3. Data  

The first two of these challenges have largely been solved. 

Although code sharing in science had a rocky start [@Barnes2010], more and more code writing by scientists is being shared, partly due to the rapid increase in training opportunities made available by organizations like The Carpentries, combined with the rapid adoption of Github by scientists [@Ram2013]. The bigger driver for this may also be connected to the rise in popularity of data science as a discipline distinct from statistics [@Donoho2017]. This rapid growth in data science has largely been fueled by easy access to open source software tools. Programming languages such as Python, R and Julia help scientists implement and share new methods to work with data. Each of these languages is supported by thriving communities of researchers and software developers who contribute many of the building blocks that make them popular. As of this writing, Python, Julia, and R have  167k packages (https://pypi.org/), ~ 14k packages (https://cran.r-project.org/) and ~2k  packages (https://pkg.julialang.org/) respectively. These packages form the building blocks of a data scientists daily workflow. 

A typical data scientist loads a dozen or two of these open source libraries at the top of a notebook and then rely on existing routines to rapidly read, transform, visualize, and model data. Each of these packages individually depend on a complex web of other packages, building upon existing work rather than reimplementing everything from scratch. Working from script and a list of such dependencies, a data analyst can easily install all the necessary tools in any local or remote environment and reproduce the computation. When new functionality is developed, it is packaged into a separate entity and added to a language's package manager.

The computing environment is also easily captured with modern tools such as Docker [@Boettiger2015; @Jupyter2018]. Modern tools such as Binder (citation) can parse Docker files and dependency trees to provide on demand, live notebooks in R and Python that a reader can immediately execute in the browser without dealing with the challenges of local installation. This makes it simple to load a specific environment to run any analysis. Code is handled by version control with tools like Git and GitHub (@git; @github), paired with archiving such as Zenodo provide access to code (particularly model implementations)[@zenodo]. All the necessary software is available from various package managers (and their numerous geographic mirrors and archives) making it easy to install any version of a software package. However, the biggest challenge, even today, remains easy and repeatable access to data in a data analysis.

Although there are numerous public and private data repositories, none  of them function as package managers. Datasets are also far more diverse in complexity, size, and formats, making them particularly challenging to standardize or easily "install" where the code is running. As a result, data used in an analysis is often read from various locations (local, network, or cloud), various formats, varying levels of tidiness [@Wickham2014]. There is also the overhead associated with data publishing, the act of archiving data in a repository that also mints permanent identifiers, that are not required of all projects due to the effort and time involved. It is worth drawing the distinction between data sharing (making the data available with little effort) and data publishing (archiving the data in a long-term repository, with our without curated metadata).

What aspects of data make them particularly challenging to share from a reproducibility perspective? This is the question we tackle in this paper.  While there are several papers that serve as best-practice guides for formatting data and getting them ready for sharing, the aims of this paper are a bit different. Our aim to address the issue of data in the context of reproducibility in data science workflows. In particular we discuss the various tradeoffs one has to consider when documenting and sharing data, when it is worth publishing and how this would change depending on the use case, perceived impact, and potential audience.

We discuss how to share and/or publish data and cover various tradeoffs when deciding how much to do. We skip detailed discussions of the minutiae of data preparation (covered elsewhere in various articles), licenses (there are not many options when it comes to data), or citation (as of this writing, data citation is still in its infancy). We also analyze the state of data contained inside software packages, shared and made available as part of modern data analysis. How often are data shipped inside software packages? How does data format and size impact availability?
